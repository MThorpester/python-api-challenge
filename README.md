# python-api-challenge - Part I: WeatherPy
This notebook analyzes weather data to better understand what the weather is like as we approach the equator.
* It visualizes the weather of 500+ randomly selected cities across the world using the the OpenWeatherMap API, and 
* creates a representative model of weather across world cities.

The project consists of:
- a Jupyter notebook (WeatherPy.ipnyb) that analyzes the .......**continue updating here**.
- the mouse metadata and study results stored in Resources\Study_results.csv and Resources\Mouse_metadata.csv

Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

The Jupyter notebook contains:
- an analysis report (at the beginning of the notebook), 
- the Python code that organizes, analyzes, formats and visualizes the data using the Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy.stats libraries  
- several tables and charts visualizing key metrics, trends and relationships between data:
  - Summary Statistics for each Drug regimen in the study
  - Bar Charts showing the number of measurements taken per Drug regimen
  - Pie Charts showing the breakdown of mice in the study by gender
  - Calculations of the quartiles and IQR for Final Tumor Volumes in the 4 Drug regimens (Capomulin, Ramacane, Infubinol & Ceftamin) and identification of any outliers in this data 
  - Side-by-side Box and Whisker Plots visualizing these calculations  
  - A Line Plot showing the progression of tumor volume over the 45 days of treatment with Capomulin for Mouse 'm601'
  - A Scatter Plot showing the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin study
  - Calculation of the correlation coefficient and linear regression model for these two variables
